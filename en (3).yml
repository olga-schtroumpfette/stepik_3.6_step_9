      faq_1:
        answer: After forwarding your email order confirmation Pie will reach out
          to the store on your behalf to initiate the VAT refund. On average you will
          be able to start claiming your VAT within 48 hours and the process in total
          will only take a couple of minutes. Refunds are being paid out within 24
          hours of your arrival back home. On your behalf, Pie will do everything
          within its capability to help claim your refund.
        question: How long does it take?
      faq_2:
        answer: Currently, we support Denmark and Norway. Look out for more countries
          being added soon.
        question: Which countries do you support?
      faq_3:
        answer: Yes, it does. You do however need to physically export the purchased
          item(s) from either Denmark or Norway. Note - this is for online orders
          shipped to Denmark and Norway, and then taken out of the EU (or Norway)
          by the purchaser. This is not for orders that are shipped outside of the
          EU.
        question: Does this work with all tax-free eligible online orders?
      faq_4:
        answer: Yes for orders from Danish and Norwegian retailers. We will work to
          help you claim your VAT refund back  and communicate on your behalf with
          the stores. However, please note some stores may opt out of the VAT refund
          scheme - which is not required by law. Regardless, Pie will work on your
          behalf to claim your refund.
        question: Are all stores eligible?
      faq_5:
        answer: Absolutely. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. All information
          is handled securely and follows all regulations and GDPR requirements.

      quote: Our mission is to support the business of our store partners in each
        country globally. We will support the business from the moment we introduce
        Pie.
      statement: Pie's mission is "Empowering Local Partners, Globally". We would
        like to support the business of our store partners in each country globally.
        The digitization of tax exemption procedures has begun to progress in Japan
        as well, but it is not just a matter of digitizing information, but what is
        really the biggest burden for store partners and how to remove that burden.
        We consider whether we can do it and provide services. From the day you introduce
        Pie, you'll notice how wasteful the tax exemption process has been.
